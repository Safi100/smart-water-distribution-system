## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB
- Python 3.x (for hardware control)
- Raspberry Pi (for IoT integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd smart-water-distribution-system
```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Install Python dependencies**
```bash
pip install flask RPi.GPIO
```

4. **Environment Setup**
Create a `.env` file with:
```env
DATABASE=mongodb+srv://..........
JWT_SECRET=thisissecretkeythdgkfdkdowmvlhgfff
EMAIL_USER=nodemail_email
PASS_USER=nodemail_password
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
SERVER_ALIVE_ENDPOINT=api_to_render_keep_server_alive
PORT=8000
```

5. **Start the servers**

Backend Server:
```bash
nodemon ./server.js
```

Hardware Control Server:
```bash
python hardware.py
```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration

### Customer Management
- `GET /api/customers` - Get all customers
- `POST /api/customers` - Create new customer
- `PUT /api/customers/:id` - Update customer
- `DELETE /api/customers/:id` - Delete customer

### Tank Management
- `GET /api/tanks` - Get all tanks
- `POST /api/tanks` - Create new tank
- `PUT /api/tanks/:id` - Update tank

## 🔧 Hardware Integration

### Flow Sensor Calibration
The system uses calibrated flow sensors with the following configuration:
```python
FLOW_PULSE_PER_LITER = 5.5  # Calibrated: 11 pulses = 2 liters
```

### Ultrasonic Sensor Setup
Tank level measurement using HC-SR04 sensors:
- 5 readings per measurement
- Average calculation for accuracy
- Distance to volume conversion

### Parallel Processing
Multiple tanks can be processed simultaneously using Python threading:
```python
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=len(tanks)) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(measure_water_flow_for_tank, tank, duration) for tank in tanks]
```
